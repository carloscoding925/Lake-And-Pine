# Lake & Pine Collective

Static marketing site for **Lake & Pine Collective**, a wedding photo and film collective based in the Reno-Tahoe area. The site is a single-page portfolio with sections for the team's story, approach, photo and film work, packages, and a contact form.

## Tech stack

The site is intentionally simple — no build step, no framework — so it stays fast and easy to maintain.

- **HTML / CSS / vanilla JS** — single `index.html`, single `styles.css`, a small inline `<script>` for the sticky-nav scroll state, mobile hamburger toggle, and reveal-on-scroll animations via `IntersectionObserver`.
- **Google Fonts** — Playfair Display, Cormorant Garamond, and Inter, loaded via `<link rel="preconnect">` for fast first paint.
- **Vimeo** — highlight films are embedded via Vimeo's iframe player rather than self-hosted, so we get adaptive-bitrate streaming, a polished player, and no Cloudflare bandwidth cost for video.
- **Cloudflare Pages / Workers** — deployment target. Configured via [`wrangler.jsonc`](web/wrangler.jsonc) with `assets.directory: "."` so the `web/` folder is served as the site root.
- **ImageMagick** — local CLI tool used to resize and recompress portfolio photos before deploy (see [Image workflow](#image-workflow)).

```

The split between `assets/` (project root) and `web/optimized-assets/` is deliberate: only files inside `web/` are served by Cloudflare, so the high-resolution originals never ship to the public site but stay available locally for re-processing.

## Local development

Open `web/index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the folder with any static server:

```bash
cd web
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```

For a closer-to-production preview that mirrors the Cloudflare environment:

```bash
npx wrangler pages dev web
```

Or simply:

```bash
open web/index.html
```

## Deployment

Deployment is handled by Cloudflare Pages. Pushes to the `main` branch trigger an automatic build and deploy of the `web/` directory.

## Image workflow

Source photos from the camera are typically 5–10 MB each — far larger than what the web needs. Before adding new photos to the portfolio:

1. Drop the originals into the project-root `assets/` folder (kept out of the deploy).
2. Resize and recompress with ImageMagick into `web/optimized-assets/`:

   ```bash
   cd assets
   for f in your-photos.jpg; do
     magick "$f" \
       -auto-orient \
       -resize '1600x1600>' \
       -strip \
       -interlace Plane \
       -sampling-factor 4:2:0 \
       -quality 82 \
       "../web/optimized-assets/$f"
   done
   ```

   Settings: max 1600px on the long edge (still crisp on retina), JPEG quality 82, EXIF stripped, progressive encoding so images render top-to-bottom as they download.

3. Reference the new file from `index.html` using a path like `optimized-assets/your-photo.jpg`.

This pipeline reduced the photo grid payload from ~36 MB → ~1.4 MB (a 96% reduction) with no visible quality loss.

## SEO & link previews

The `<head>` includes Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags pointing at `og-image.png` (the company logo, 1200×1200), so the site renders a proper preview card when shared via iMessage, Slack, Twitter, Discord, etc.
